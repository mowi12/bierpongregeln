# Rules and Regulations

## Purpose and Use

<hr />

### Purpose of the Rules

The beer pong rules and all [flavors](#flavors) exist for the following reasons:

-   Fairness to all players
-   No discussions during the game
-   Smooth process

### Use of the Rules

The beer pong rules and all flavors are mainly used for tournaments, but can also be used without the [tournament procedure](#tournament-procedure) section. The rules can be used for individual and team tournaments or games. In the following, team only refers to a team, the number of players is not defined.

## Flavors

<hr />

The rulebook contains all the basic rules that are important for playing a game of beer pong. Flavors are different variants that have developed over time. In order to provide a good overview of these variants, only the deviations from the normal basic rules are recorded in the Flavors section.

Current variants are:

-   [Moritz (standard tournament flavor)](flavors/moritz)
-   [Felix](flavors/felix)
-   [Marcel](flavors/marcel)
-   [Game Pigeon](flavors/game_pigeon)
-   [3D](flavors/3d)
-   [More Balls](flavors/mehr_baelle)
-   [Sniper](flavors/sniper)
-   [Double Table](flavors/double_table)

Of course, different variants or flavors can also be combined. How and whether different flavors can be combined with each other is indicated for each flavor.

## Preparation

<hr />

-   All cups (10 per team) must be set up in a 2D pyramid formation before the start of the game (more on this under [cup formation](#cup-formation)).
-   All cups of both teams must be filled equally with water or beer before the start of the game.
-   It must be agreed which flavor will be used.

### Cup Formation

-   Each team has 10 cups on its own side of the table.
-   All cups must be placed in a 2D pyramid formation. The tip of the pyramid must point to the other side of the table and all the edges of the cups must be touching.
-   The pyramid formation must either be placed on the marked spot on the beer pong table or the rear four cups must be placed on the rear edge of the table.

## Tournament Procedure

<hr />

There are no general tournament procedures. How exactly a tournament plays out depends entirely on how many people are there and whether a single or team tournament is being played. Further details will be clarified on site.

## General Rules

<hr />

### General Information

#### Art 1 - Drinking

1. When a cup is hit, all team members must drink the amount specified before the start of the game.
2. Drinking is not allowed until all the opposing team's throws have been completed.
3. If the opposing team drinks despite not having to drink or distracts itself with other activities, a throw may be made.
4. If a team member forgets to drink before the next round, the opposing team may assess an appropriate penalty to the entire team. A shot round is recommended.

#### Art 2 - Removing the Cups

1. All cups hit by the first two balls of each round are not removed until both throws are over.
2. The special cup is always removed on every special throw.
3. In the case of special throws in which more than just the cup hit is removed, adjacent cups are removed first. Only then may cups that are not directly adjacent to the special cup be removed.
4. The additional cups to be removed may be selected by the team to which they belong.

#### Art 3 - Throwing

1. Each team has two standard throws in each round.
2. The number of throws per round can be increased by special throws.
3. In a team game, it must be agreed for each team before the start of the game how to throw. If a team decides that each person will throw one ball in each round, this method of throwing must be adhered to for the entire game.
4. The elbow must remain behind the edge of the table when throwing.
5. In the case of an individual game, it is not permitted for both balls to be thrown at the same time.
6. In the case of a team game, it is permitted for both balls to be thrown at the same time.
7. If a ball slips or falls out of the hand during the throw, this ball may be thrown again as long as it has not yet rolled or flown over the center line.
8. If a ball slips out of the hand during the throw and lands in its own cup, this ball has not rolled over the center line, but still counts as a hit and must be put away. The ball may not be thrown again.

#### Art 4 - Millane technique

1. In the Millane technique, when a person is standing to the side of the table, the elbow must still remain behind the extended edge of the table.
2. The Millane technique may only be used if it does not hinder another person.

#### Art 5 - Straightening / Assembling Cups

1. A player may ask the other team to adjust the cups. Straightening only means readjusting the cup to its original position. The opposing team must comply with this request and straighten the cups.
2. The opposing team may not adjust the cups without the permission of the other team.
3. A player may ask the other team to put the cups together. The formation may be chosen by the own team.
4. Each team may only assemble its cups once in the entire game.

#### Art 6 - Removing the Ball

1. A player may ask the other team to remove the ball from a cup if it is in it. The opposing team may also do so without a request.

### Game Procedure

#### Art 7 - Deciding the Order and Side

1. To determine the order and side of the game, one person on each side receives a ball. Both people must now try to hit one of the opposing team's cups at the same time.
2. Both people must look each other in the eye when throwing.
3. The team that hits first gets to decide which team starts. The team that misses gets to decide which side of the table they play on.
4. If both throwers hit, the throw must be repeated by the same throwers.

#### Art 8 - Game Procedure

1. The winners of the [starting throw](#art-7---deciding-the-order-and-side) now start with the two regular throws.
2. After all throws have been completed, it is the other team's turn. This is repeated until only one team has cups left on their side.

#### Art 9 - End of the Game

1. The game ends as soon as one team has no more cups and the point [Counter](#art-10---counter) has been dealt with.
2. If the game is played with a timer, it also ends as soon as the timer runs out. If the game is tied at this point, the team that hits an opponent's cup next wins. There is no counter-attack.
3. The team with fewer cups on its own side wins.

#### Art 10 - Counter

1. Only the team that has not started the game has the opportunity to complete a counterattack.
2. There is no limit to the number of counter-attacks that can be made.
3. A counterattack attempt is successful if the second team can finish the game in this last round.
4. After a successful counterattack, all cups from the last two rounds remain in place and are not put away. It is now the turn of the team that almost won the game.

### Standard Game

#### Art 11 - Balls Back

1. If both throws are hit in a throwing round, the current team may throw again.
2. Before throwing again, the two hit cups must be removed.

#### Art 12 - Bouncer

1. A ball that bounces at least once on the table and lands in a cup counts as a Bouncer and therefore as two hits.
2. As soon as a ball has touched down at least once on the table or an object on the table, it may be defended against.

#### Art 13 - Knocking over Cups

1. If a team knocks over one or more of its own cups during the game, one of its own cups must be removed.
2. The last cup may not be removed by knocking it over. This is an appeal to the fairness of the other players.

#### Art 14 - Blowing/Fingering

1. It is not allowed to save a ball that is not yet completely in the cup with blowing or fingering.

#### Art 15 - Trickshot

1. If a ball rolls back to its own side of the table after a throw, i.e. over the middle of the table, the current throwing team may retrieve the ball. The player who retrieved the ball may take a trick shot. This must be thrown after the regular throws. In addition, cups hit by regular balls are removed first.
2. A ball is only considered to have rolled back if it is on the player's own half of the table. If it rolls back into the opponent's half, the ball may no longer be retrieved.
3. Cups that have been hit by a trick shot must be removed immediately.
4. If a trickshot ball rolls back to your own half of the table, it can also be retrieved and another trickshot can be made.
5. A trick shot does not count as an air ball if it is caught behind the edge of the table.

#### Art 16 - Bomb

1. If both throws of a team hit the same cup in a throwing round, this cup and two other cups must be removed.
2. A bomb immediately leads to the execution of the balls-back rule.
