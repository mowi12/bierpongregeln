## Tournament Procedure

<hr />

<Highlight>If a tournament is played in which there are semi-finals and finals, the drinking game horse racing is played in these rounds. This means that each person taking part in the tournament must choose a person from the current round and place a number of sips on this person. Once the person who has won the current round has been determined, everyone who has bet correctly may distribute the number of sips they have bet to others. The person who bet on the wrong person must drink the sips they bet themselves.</Highlight>

## General Rules

<hr />

### General Information

#### Art 1 - Drinking

1. If a cup is hit, <Highlight>the person who hit the cup must drink the amount agreed before the game.</Highlight>
2. <del><Highlight>Drinking is not allowed until all the opposing team's throws have been completed.</Highlight></del>
4. If a team member forgets to drink before the next round, <Highlight>the cup does not count as a hit and is put back in its old place. If the arrangement of all the cups has been changed by putting the cup away, the old arrangement must be restored.</Highlight>

### Standard Game

#### Art 12 - Bouncer

3. <Highlight>A ball that has touched down or rolled at least once on a cup and lands in a cup does not count as a bouncer, but gets another throw.</Highlight>

#### Art 16 - Bomb

3. <Highlight>The game may not be ended with a bomb. This means that as soon as there is an opportunity to end the game with a bomb in a throwing round (a combination of bomb and touchdown does not count here), a cup remains in place if it is successfully hit. The opposing team can choose which cups are put away.</Highlight>

### Special rules

#### Art - <Highlight>Dead Cup</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If a cup that has been hit remains standing at the end of a round, this cup counts as a dead cup. If the opposing team hits this cup in a subsequent round, the team that hit the dead cup wins immediately.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>If a person on the team with the dead cup realizes that they have a dead cup, they may remove this cup. However, this may not happen within an opponent's throwing round.</Highlight>

#### Art - <Highlight>Island</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If a cup stands alone, i.e. has no neighbors, a player can call Island on this cup. If it is hit, the hit cup and another cup must be removed. If another cup is hit instead of the Island cup, the hit does not count.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>Each player may call Island once during the entire game.</Highlight>
