### Special Rules

#### Art - <Highlight>Dead Cup</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If a hit cup remains at the end of a round, this cup counts as a dead cup. If the opposing team hits this cup in a subsequent round, the team that hit the dead cup wins immediately.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>If a person on the team with the dead cup realizes that they have a dead cup, they may remove this cup. However, this may not be done within an opponent's throwing round.</Highlight>

#### Art - <Highlight>On Fire</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If a player hits two balls in a row, he may call Heating Up. If the same player hits another third cup in a row and shouts On Fire, he is On Fire. He may throw until he no longer hits the ball.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>Heating Up and On Fire do not have to be called in the same throwing round.</Highlight>
3. <Highlight>If Heating Up or On Fire has not been called, the player can call Heating Up or On Fire on the next hit in succession.</Highlight>
4. <Highlight>The On Fire throws are executed immediately after the call.</Highlight>
5. <Highlight>Jumps and other special throws only count as one hit.</Highlight>

#### Art - <Highlight>Island</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If a cup stands alone, i.e. has no neighbors, a player can call Iceland on this cup. If it is hit, the hit cup and another cup must be removed. If another cup is hit instead of the Iceland cup, the hit does not count.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>Each player may call Iceland once during the entire game.</Highlight>

#### Art - <Highlight>Air Ball</Highlight>

1. <Highlight>If an air ball is caught behind the edge of the table, the catcher of the ball (as long as he is on the opposing team) may throw a ball twice in the next throwing round.</Highlight>
2. <Highlight>A ball counts as an air ball if it does not touch an object or similar and is caught behind the table top.</Highlight>
3. <Highlight>Balls that are thrown to the side of the table or caught there do not count as an air ball.</Highlight>
